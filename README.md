# matplotlib_challenge


### Challenge Objective 
Using matplotlib, compare the performance of various drug treatments

### Analysing the dataset
1. Generated summary statistics - mean, median, variance, standard deviation, standard error of the mean (SEM)
2. Used bar and pie chart to analyse the mice gender and the treatment received
3. Calculated quartiles, located outliers and generated box plot for the top four treatments 
4. Created line and scatter plot to analyse change in tumor volume for a specific treatment.
5. Calculated correlation and regression between mice weight and tumor vol under a specific treatment
